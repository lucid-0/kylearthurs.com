    <h1>Software Development</h1>
    <h2>University</h2>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh with an undergraduate degree in computer science in the fall of 2017. 
     The program had a software engineering emphasis. My <a href="{% static "/main/documents/arthurs-resume.pdf" %}">resumé</a> includes some more details about my education overall.</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Please see my <a href="{% static "/main/documents/arthurs-resume.pdf" %}">resumé</a>. Some background in the section below.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>I have been interested in computing since the mid-1990s. Living in rural WI with limited access to technology and connectivity, my family got our first Packard Bell PC running MS DOS and later a Compaq PC with Windows 98 and a 56k modem.
    As a hobby in high school, I repaired and sold computers that I bought at thrift stores.
    I also created primitive games and programs using Microsoft's Visual Basic, web technology, and eventually Linux and Python.
    After I decided to switch majors from business management and finance to computer science, I completed two internships and a university practicum, and graduated to working full time as a software developer.</p>
