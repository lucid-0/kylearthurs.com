    <h1>Philosophy</h1>
    <h2>University</h2>
    I completed an undergraduate minor in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh in 2017.
    I appreciate various studies such as ontology, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy's place in the history of science as well as in our daily lives and politics.
